#  Airport Ticketing & Management System (C++ & Python)

## üíª Core: C++
Manages flights, passengers, and bookings

Key OOP concepts: Flight, Aircraft, Passenger, Ticket

vectors, structs, classes

file I/O to write .csv reports

system("python script.py") to trigger analytics (optional)

## ‚úàÔ∏è Modules & Menus

Reports & Analytics

Export CSV for analytics

Load factors, busiest routes, etc.

Admin Options

## üêç Analytics: Python + Pandas/Matplotlib
Reads CSVs generated by C++

Performs:

Load factor analysis

Route popularity

Flight occupancy stats

Visualizes data using bar/line charts

üß† How It Connects
C++ saves structured .csv files (e.g., flights.csv, passengers.csv)

Python scripts read these files and produce analytics

Optionally, Python can be triggered by C++ via system("python analytics.py")
